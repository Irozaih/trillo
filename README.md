## Flexbox

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container, a parent element with `display: flex` the ability to expand children elements to fill available free space or shrink them to prevent overflow, and thus best utilize the available space. Also, their order can easily be rearranged using the CSS `order` property.

As stated on the [MDN Flexbox Page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox), some of the best use cases for flexbox are:

> - Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
> - Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
> - Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.

Flexbox is supported in all major browsers except IE 9 and lower. [See browser support on caniuse.com website.](https://caniuse.com/?search=flexbox "Can I use flexbox?")
